# Random Token WebApp

### Description 

*This repo is the outcome of a 4 hours sprint project.*

It consists of a very simple Web App coded using vanilla JavaScript and very basic HTML/CSS. Its purpose is to fetch a random token on Ethereum chain and compute a few basic financial indicators along with displaying the price chart. 

No general framework were used, that would have made generation of static pages more simple. React for instance would have been nice to use.

### Run 

```
git clone https://github.com/thsgr/Random-Token-Moralis-WebApp.git
cd Random-Token-Moralis-WebApp
npm install -g live-server
live-server
```
